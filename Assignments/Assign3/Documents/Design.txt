--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this document, we state and explain all the design details that we have followed.

Firstly, there are some common points to note about each class.

-- Blocked Copy Constructor and Copy Assignment Operator : 
   Consider a class ExampleClass.
   The copy constructor ExampleClass(const ExampleClass&) and the copy assignment operator ExampleClass& operator=(const ExampleClass&)
   have been blocked by making them private data members.
   By making them private, we prevent users from using them because if anyone tries to use them outside the class, then it will give a compilation error.
   The main purpose of blocking them is to ensure that objects of UDTs are passed by reference.
   Note that the copy assignment operator is blocked for all the classes. The copy constructor is blocked for all classes except 'Station' and 'Date'.

-- Passing objects and built-in types : 
   At all places, objects of UDTs are passed by reference as this helps in minimizing memory consumption, as no copy of the object is created.
   Also, if objects are passed by value, then always the copy constructor would have to be invoked and 
   if the copy constructor is not provided explicitly by us, then the default copy constructor may mess up in a deep copy and a shallow copy.
   Also, built-in data types like int are always passed by value.

-- Singleton classes : 
   At many places, we have made classes to be singleton classes, for example, class Railways and all the 7 concrete booking classes are singleton classes.
   Here, to implement them, we have used the Meyer's Singleton. Hence, for these classes, the constructor and destructor are made private.
   For each of these classes, we have a Type() member function which returns the singleton instance of the respective class.

-- Friend ostream operator function : 
   Each class has the overloaded output streaming operator implemented as a fried function : friend ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const ExampleClass&)
   The ostream and ExampleClass objects are passed by reference.
   Using a friend function is the only viable option because if we wanted to keep it in the ostream class,
   then we would have to change the iostream library, which is not possible.
   If we wanted to keep it in the ExampleClass class, then the usual semantics of the << operator would get changed.
   Hence the only option is to use a friend function as this achieves our purpose and also preserves the encapsulation.

-- Unit Testing Functions : 
   Each class has a member function like static void UnitTestExampleClass() for unit testing the respective class.
   It is made static so that we can easily call this member function without having to explicitly create an object of the class.
   In the unit testing functions, we have used assert statements to compare the output with the golden output.
   assert statements are very useful as in case of a mismatch, they report the line number along with the condition that failed and also stop the execution
   of the program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, we delve deep into each class and look at the design paradigms for each of them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. class 'Station'

-- private data members / member functions / operator functions

    -- const string name_ : Attribute to store the name of each Station. 
       It has been made const as the name of a Station object will not change in future after it has been created.

    -- Station& operator=(const Station&) : Blocked copy assignment operator

-- public member functions

    -- Station(const string&) : Constructor which takes a string which is a const reference as argument. 
       The argument is made const as we will not be changing it.
       The constructor is public because we need to create objects of the Station class from even outside the class.
    
    -- Station(const Station&) : Copy Constructor with usual semantics.
       The argument has to be passed as reference else we enter an infinite loop where the copy constructor keeps on calling itself.
       Here we need a copy constructor as it is required in the initializer lists of other classes like Booking etc.
    
    -- ~Station() : Destructor
    
    -- string GetName() const : The method is made const because it does not need to change the attributes of any object.
    
    -- int GetDistance(const Station&) const : This method takes a Station object as a const reference as it does not need to change it.
       It calls the GetDistance method of the Railways class to get the distance between two stations.

    -- friend ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const Station&) : Output streaming operator.

    -- static void UnitTestStation() : Static function for unit testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. class 'Railways' - a singleton class

-- private data members / member functions / operator functions

    -- static const vector<Station> sStations : A vector of Station objects that stores the master data, i.e., the list of all Stations.
       It is made static as it needs to be accessed from the beginning till the end of the program.
       It is made const because the list of Stations is already given and never changes in the future.
    
    -- static const map<pair<string, string>, int> sDistStations : This stores the pairwise distances between all Stations. 
       It is implemented as a map<pair<string, string>, int>.
       The key is a pair of strings which is actually the pair of Stations and the value is an int which is the distance between these 2 Stations.
       Thus, just by knowing the names of the Stations, we can easily retrieve the distance between them.
       It is also made static as it is required at multiple times during the execution and const because it never changes in the future. 

       Both sStations and sDistStations are initialized in Railways.cpp at the beginning itself because 
       these are constants which will stay constant throughout all runs of the application. Hence, it is best to initialize them in the library itself.
    
    -- Railways() : Empty Constructor.
    
    -- ~Railways() : Destructor.

    -- Railways(const Railways&) : Blocked copy constructor.
    
    -- Railways& operator=(const Railways&) : Blocked copy assignment operator.

-- public member functions

    -- static const Railways& Type() : This function implements the Meyer's Singleton and returns the singleton object.
       It has to be made static because this function itself returns the single instance. 
       If it is not static, then for the first call to this function we will not have any instance, and we will not be able to call it.
       Hence it has to be made static.

    -- int GetDistance(const Station&, const Station&) const : This is a const function as it only returns the distance between two Stations and 
       does not need to change the state of any object. The arguments as usual are passed a const references. 
       This function retrieves the distance between Stations from the map sDistStations by using the pair of Station names as the key.

    -- friend ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const Railways&) : Output streaming operator.

    -- static void UnitTestRailways() : Static function for unit testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. class 'Date'

-- private data members / member functions / operator functions

    -- static const vector<string> sMonthNames : A vector of strings to store the names of the 12 months.
       It is made static as we need it at multiple times and places during the execution. 
       It is const as it will never change as the names of the 12 months cannot change.
    
    -- static const vector<string> sDayNames : A vector of strings to store the names of the 7 days of the week.
       It is made static as we need it at multiple instances during the execution. 
       It is const as it will never change as the names of the days of the week cannot change.

       Both sMonthNames and sDayNames never change in the future and remain constant throughout all runs of the program, 
       hence they are initialized in the library itself at the beginning of Date.cpp.
    
    -- const int date_, const Month month_, const int year_ : These have been made const as they will not change after the object has been created.

    -- Date& operator=(const Date&) : Blocked copy assignment operator.

-- public member functions

    -- Date(int, int, int) : Constructor which takes three integers as arguments (passed by value).
    
    -- Date(const Date&) : Copy Constructor with usual semantics. It has been defined as it is needed in the initializer list of the class Booking.
    
    -- ~Date() : Destructor.
    
    -- Day day() const : This function returns an integer from 0-6 depending on the day of the week with 0 denoting Sunday.
       It uses the ctime library to perform this task. It is made const as it does not change the state of the Date object.

    -- friend ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const Date&) : Output Streaming Operator.
    
    -- static void UnitTestDate() : Static function for unit testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. The hierarchy of 'BookingClasses'

First, let us try to understand how we have created the hierarchy for this collection of classes.
The hierarchy structure looks like this : 

                                                       BookingClasses
                                                         (abstract)
                                                             |
                                       ---------------------------------------------
                                       |                                           |
                                     Berth                                        Seat
                                   (abstract)                                  (abstract)
                                       |                                           |
                   -----------------------------------                   ---------------------
                   |                                 |                   |                   |
                 Tiers2                            Tiers3             ACChairCar       SecondSitting
               (abstract)                        (abstract)
                   |                                 |
    -----------------------------             ---------------
    |              |            |             |             |
ACFirstClass    AC2Tier     FirstClass      AC3Tier       Sleeper


At the root of the hierarchy, we have the abstract base class 'BookingClasses'. After this we create sub-classes on the basis of the Seat / Berth property.
So we create two abstract child classes : 'Berth' (for all booking classes having sleeping berths), and 'Seat' (for all booking classes having just seats).
Then we introduce another level of abstract classes based on the property of number of tiers. For any booking class with just seats, 
number of tiers is always 0, and hence we can just create the concrete classes 'ACChairCar' and 'SecondSitting' here itself as sub-classes of 'Seat'. 
However, for 'Berth', we create 2 more sub-classes : 'Tiers2' (for booking classes with 2 tiers) and 'Tiers3' (for booking classes with 3 tiers).
Then at the next level, we introduce the rest of the concrete classes. We make 'ACFirstClass', 'AC2Tier' and 'FirstClass' as sub-classes of 'Tiers2' and 
'AC3Tier' and 'Sleeper' as sub-classes of Tiers3.

Now, let us go to the specific details of these classes.

1. class 'BookingClasses'

-- protected data members / member functions / operator functions

    -- const string name_, const bool isAC_, const bool isLuxury_ : These have been made data members as they are not good properties for inheritance.
       They are made const because once initialized, their valeus will not change.

    -- BookingClasses(const string&, const bool, const bool) : A constructor for the class. Though we cannot instantiate the abstract base class,
       but a constructor is necessary for initializing the attributes for the derived classes, because always the base class object is created 
       before the derived class object is created.

    -- virtual ~BookingClasses() : A virtual destructor, because the root of every polymorphic hierarchy must have a virtual destructor for proper destruction
       and cleaning up of derived class objects and to prevent slicing of derived class objects.

-- public member functions

    -- virtual double GetLoadFactor() const = 0 : The load factors are made static constants in the 7 derived concrete classes itself. 
       Hence we cannot access them from the base class. Thus, we make this function pure virtual and then redefine it again 
       in the 7 derived concrete classes.
    
    -- string GetName() const : A non-polymorphic function to return the name_ of the booking class. The base class instance of the booking class object 
       has the name_ information and hence we can directly return this from here itself.
    
    -- virtual bool IsSitting() const = 0 : We perform inheritance based on the property of sitting / sleeping, hence we make it pure virtual so that 
       we can redefine this function in the 2 abstract child classes Seat and Berth.
    
    -- bool IsAC() const : A non-polymorphic function. We do not use the AC / Non-AC property for inheritance and hence,
       we can directly return the attribute isAC_ from here itself.
    
    -- virtual int GetNumberOfTiers() const = 0 : We perform second-level inheritance based on the property of number of tiers, 
       hence we make it pure virtual so that we can redefine this function in the abstract child classes.
    
    -- bool IsLuxury() const : It is a non-polymorphic function. We do not use the luxury / ordinary property for inheritance and hence,
       we can directly return the attribute isLuxury_ from here itself.

       Also note that all these functions are made const because they do not need to change the state of the object.
       They are just getter functions.

    -- friend ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const BookingClasses&) : Output streaming operator capable of printing the object of any concrete booking class.

2. class 'Berth'

-- protected member functions

    -- Berth(const string&, const bool, const bool) : Constructor which actually calls the constructor of its parent class 'BookingClasses'.
    
    -- ~Berth() : Destructor

-- public member functions

    -- virtual bool IsSitting() const : We redefine this function here and return a value false directly as the class Berth serves as the 
       abstract base class for all booking classes with sleeping berths.

3. class 'Seat'

-- protected member functions

    -- Seat(const string&, const bool, const bool) : Constructor which actually calls the constructor of its parent class 'BookingClasses'.

    -- ~Seat() : Destructor

-- public member functions

    -- virtual bool IsSitting() const : We redefine this function here and return a value true directly as the class Seat serves as the 
       abstract base class for all booking classes with just sitting facility.
    
    -- virtual int GetNumberOfTiers() const : We also redefine this function and return a value 0 as all booking classes with Seats have
       number of tiers as 0.

4. class 'Tiers2'

-- protected member functions

    -- Tiers2(const string&, const bool, const bool) : Constructor which in turn calls the constructor of the 'Berth' class.
    
    -- ~Tiers2() : Destructor

-- public member functions

    -- virtual int GetNumberOfTiers() const : We redefine this function as the class 'Tiers2' serves as the abstract base class for all booking classes 
       with 2 tiers. Hence we directly return a value of 2 from here.

5. class 'Tiers3'
   (entirely similar to the class 'Tiers2')

6. The 7 concrete booking classes

    -- All these classes have the necessary semantics to implement a Meyer's Singleton, i.e. a private constructor and destructor and a Type() function 
       to return the singleton instance.

    -- They also have each a static const loadFactor_ to store the load factor of each booking class.

       The load factors are initialized in the application space as they can change during multiple runs of the program, and hence by doing this,
       it will be easy to change them if required from the application space itself without touching the library.

    -- They all redefine the function double GetLoadFactor() const, and return the appropriate loadFactor_ from this function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. class 'Passenger'

For now, the class 'Passenger' is just an abstract class. It has no specific role in this assignment.
We have made it an abstract base class as in future, it may be the root of a polymorphic hierarchy based on the category of the passenger.

-- protected data members

    -- const string name_, const string aadhaar_, const Date dateOfBirth_, const Gender gender_, string mobile_, const string category_ : 
       These are all made const except mobile_ because they cannot change for a person.
       They are made protected so that they can be inherited in case of a future extension.

-- public member functions

    -- virtual string GetCategory() = 0 : It is made a pure virtual function to make tha class 'Passenger' an abstract class, 
       and also because this may be the root of a polymorphic hierarchy in future, and we may need to override and re-define this function in the child classes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F. class 'Booking'

-- private data members / member functions / operator functions

    -- const Station fromStation_ : Made const as once the booking is made, the station from which the booking is done will never change.
    
    -- const Station toStation_ : Made const as once the booking is made, the station upto which the booking is done will never change.
       For initializing fromStation_ and toStation_ in the initializer list of the constructor of class Booking, 
       we needed the copy constructor for the Station class.
    
    -- const Date date_ : This is also made const as date of travel will not change once the booking has been done.
       For initializing this in the initializer list, we needed the copy constructor of the Date class.
    
    -- const BookingClasses& bookingClass_ : Made const as the booking class will not change after the booking.
       It has been made a reference because all booking classes are singleton classes, hence there is only one instance (object) for each of them.
       Thus, whenever we need to use a booking class object, we will have to use a reference to that single instance.
    
    -- const Passenger* passenger_ : To store the passenger details. Made const as the passenger details cannot change after a booking.
       It is kept as a pointer to the Passenger object because it is made nullable for now.
    
    -- bool bookingStatus_ : It is kept as a bool variable as it can either be true (successfull booking) or false (unsuccessfull booking).
       Although, in this assignment, it will always be true. It is however not made const because in future extensions, it may happen that 
       due to some vacancy or some other circumstances, the bookingStatus_ changes from false to true.
       It may also happen that someone cancels their booking, then the status will change from true to false.
    
    -- string bookingMessage_ : It is a message like "BOOKING SUCCEEDED". It is not made const as in future extensions, it may happen that
       due to some event the bookingMessage_ can change from "BOOKING FAILED" to "BOOKING SUCCEEDED" due to some vacancy or something like that.
    
    -- int fare_ : The fare computed for the booking using the ComputeFare() method.
    
    -- const int PNR_ : Made const as the PNR_ is kind of a unique ID for each booking, and hence will always remain constant for the booking.
    
    -- static int sBookingPNRSerial : A static variable to keep track of the next PNR_ to be allocated. 
       It is made static as we need a single copy of this for all the Booking objects. Hence it cannot be object-specific.
       It is not made const as its value increases by one every time a new Booking is made.

    -- Booking(const Booking&) : Blocked copy constructor.

    -- Booking& operator=(const Booking&) : Blocked copy assignment operator.

-- public data members / member functions

    -- static const double sBaseFarePerKM, static const int sACSurcharge, static const int sLuxuryTaxPercent : 
       These constants are required in the program from start to end hence they are made static.

       They are made const because they are constant for one execution of the program, although may change from time to time during multiple executions.
       That is why they are initialized in the Application space and can be easily changed from there itself whenever required without touching the library.

    -- static vector<Booking*> sBookings : This is a vector of pointers to objects of the Booking classes. 
       This is basically a list of all the Bookings made till now. It is made static as we need a single copy of the list irrespective of the objects.
       It is however not const as it gets updated whenever a new Booking is made.

    -- Booking(const Station&, const Station&, const Date&, const BookingClasses&, bool = true, const string& = "BOOKING SUCCEEDED", Passenger* = NULL) :
       This constructor takes UDTs as arguments as const references. There are 3 default parameters - bookingStatus_, bookingMessage_ and passenger_.
       They are defaulted because they are fixed for this assignment.
    
    -- virtual ~Booking() : The destructor is made virtual as in future, the class Booking may be the root of a polymorphic hierarchy.
       This may happen when we introduce different classes for different categories of passengers.
    
    -- virtual int ComputeFare() : It is made virtual as in future, there may be a polymorphic extension of the Booking class, 
       and then we may have different fare computation logics for different categories of passengers, and that may lead to overriding the ComputeFare
       function in the child classes.

    -- friend ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const Booking&) : Output streaming operator.
    
    -- static void UnitTestBooking() : Static function for unit testing.
